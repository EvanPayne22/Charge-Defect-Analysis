Generate the corrrectionEnergies.csv file using files from vasp with correction values obtained using sxdefectalign written by Christoph Freysoldt. The correction values can also be obtained using other methods but the code requires the exact formatting shown in the correctionEnergies.csv.

The correctionEnergies.csv can be generated by using the bash script labeled sxdefectalign.sh. The script will require the dielectric tensor, location of the defect, and a correctly formatted file system.
An example for the file system is also attached.
The location of the defects was written in the top of the POSCAR to be used for this script.

Use the totalvAtoms.py to generate a file with seperated charges and the delta V correction energies. 
The delta V correction energies is the correction needed for similar defects happening close to the formed defect that is being observed.

The testFile.csv generated in totalvAtoms.py can be used in both the defectEnergyCalculator.py and defectPlotter.py.
The defectEnergyCalculator.py will plot all indiviual charge states of a defect over a range of fermi energies.
The defectPlotter.py will plot the lowest energy charge defects individually and in a complete plot with all of the other defects.
Notes: As long as the testFile.csv looks the same as the given example then it does not need to be run through totalvAtoms.py.

All of the plots are also located in the repository as examples to see exactly what I am talking about.
